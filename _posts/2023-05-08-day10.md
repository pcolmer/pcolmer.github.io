OK ... this is where we start to live Groundhog Day for real. We continue to move the clocks forward and it has got to the point where my watch has run out of timezones and it now thinks it is Sunday 7th May! That's for tomorrow ...

The ship has started sailing away from the Russian coastline, towards the Bering Sea:

We went to a cooking demonstration in the morning, watching one of the ship's chefs show us how to make Paris Brest, as well as providing some of the history of this dessert.

Then it was another round of progressive trivia. We got mentioned in dispatches this morning with the Cruise Director reading out the top three teams at the start of his Viking Daily show ... and we were in at #3! He also liked our team name ("What Time Is It?"). Unfortunately, today's round of questions were **really** tough for us ... we only got 8 out of a possible 15. It is only a game ...!

In the afternoon, my wife had an 80 minute Swedish massage at the spa while I braved Deck 2 ... I managed to do 4 laps but got pretty wet in the process and the ship was pitching & lurching quite a bit during that. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the massage ... so much so that I immediately booked another session for her before the cruise ends.

Pre-dinner, off to the Explorers' Lounge for drinks. The weather had calmed down a bit and there was blue sky visible!

Dinner in the Restaurant tonight. We both had the Moroccan Harissa Lamb Soup (chickpeas, lentils, basmati rice & coriander) and the Roast Turkey (pumpkin mash, beans, stuffing & gravy with added steamed vegetables). My wife then had the Viennese Apple Strudel with bourbon vanilla gelato while I had the Chocolate Flabbergast (creamy & dense chocolate based, rocher shell, tonka cream).

After dinner, off to the Star Theatre for the Viking Orion's Liars Club where four of the officers each gave a definition for four different words, like "fullfart" and "willywas". A good deal of hilarity and not just because of the words themselves, but also because of the definitions and some of the rambling from the contestants.
