We are about to embark on our third ocean cruise with Viking. This one is the North Pacific Passage on the Viking Orion:

One of the reasons we picked this particular itinerary is because my wife & I have wanted to go back to visit Alaska after going there with Disney Cruise Line, and the different ports of call through Alaska on this cruise appealed to us.

This page will act as a master index page of blog posts for the cruise.
