Today's flight left Heathrow at 11:05am. Given that it was Easter weekend, we didn't want to take a change on the trains on a Sunday and stay overnight at the airport so, instead, we booked a taxi to pick us up at 6:15am ... so a 5:15am alarm. This, on top of the clocks going forwards the day before and also essentially "losing" another hour by flying to Europe.

Still, we had plenty of time at the airport for breakfast before boarding the plane. Since we were flying economy on a short-haul flight, you don't get given anything beyond a bottle of water and a snack, so we bought "meal deals" in the airport - sandwiches, drink and a snack - to eat on board the plane. I'm glad we did because, with the time change, we landed around 2:10pm ... but didn't get our suitcases until well after 3pm and then didn't get to the ship until 4pm.

So we didn't really do much for the rest of the day except unpack, unwind and eat/drink. Our suitcases didn't take long to arrive at our rooms as they had travelled from the airport on the same coach as us. We decided, though, that we would eat in the World Cafe rather than the restaurant tonight. One of the reasons why is that the overall menu didn't really appeal that much, but the advantage of eating in the Cafe is that, although the offering is *mostly* the same as that in the restaurant, it is a buffet, so you can have as much or as little of anything that takes your fancy.

We've got the Silver Service package which means that my wife picked her wine from the extended menu, and she chose the Fishbone Black Label Shiraz:
