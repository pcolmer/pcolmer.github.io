We awoke to an announcement played into the staterooms from the Captain, saying that there had been a medical emergency resulting in us reversing course and heading back so that the Coast Guard could reach us by helicopter to pick up the passenger. He confirmed that the passenger is OK but the detour meant we couldn't reach Valdez. Instead, we had another day at sea.

So I spent most of the day working on the blog, making the video, etc. The speed of the Internet means that it takes most of the day for my wife's photographs to sync to OneDrive before I can use them, so having an extra day to work on everything was very useful.

It was really nice to have a day at sea after two days of really excellent excursions. It gave us some time to really appreciate and absorb what we had seen.

We ate at the World Cafe for lunch and dinner, and ended the day with the show at the Star Theatre of a comedian magician. It was ... OK.

So that was day 17. Tomorrow ... fingers crossed ... the Hubbard Glacier.
