One might have imagined that, with this being a day at sea, it might be a nice, slow day with lots of opportunity for rest and relaxtion.

Not today. Up at 5:15am (!) to see the [island of Stromboli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli) with one of the four active volcanoes in Italy!

Despite the fact that Mount Stromboli has been erupting almost continuously for over 2,000 years, there are villages on the island! It is difficult to say how it felt, getting up that early, walking along the corridor of a sleeping ship and standing with other enthusiastic passengers waiting for each little "burp" from the volcano, as the sun started to rise and allow the island to be seen.

Kudos to the ship and the crew for making this possible and positioning the ship so that we had a really great view.

After that, it was pretty much a day of rest! Breakfast, reading, trivia (did really badly), lunch, more reading, dinner and then another movie from Viking's 100 Top Classic collection - "How to steal a million" with Peter O'Toole and Audrey Hepburn. The one kink in the day was needing to put our clocks forward an hour at 10am in preparation for our day at Corfu.

Such a hardship!
