A couple of other things that relate to the staterooms and to how Viking treats guests generally:

* There is no loyalty scheme other than a discount on sailings after you've been a customer once.
* There is no part of the ship that is "exclusive" to guests in certain staterooms or who have done a certain number of cruises.
* The only notable and practical difference between the staterooms (apart from space) is how early you can book excursions and the alternative restaurants.

Our 4th consecutive day at sea and our 4th clock adjustment.

Our trivia team, after the three previous days of scoring 11, 12 and 13 out of 15, is now in the Top 5 teams. Today, we managed 13 again! Just didn't know how long the Suez Canal was or the name of the first National Park in Australia. Some of the other questions were pretty tricky and we were really pleasantly surprised to have got so many correct!

My wife & I had originally been planning to exercise/do deck walks in the afternoon but losing the hour each day has meant that afternoons suddenly get shorter! We've therefore switched to doing that in the morning. Not today, though - we were so tired after staying up to watch the Coronation! So we squeezed in the walk after the clocks changed and completed 6 laps (1.5 miles) on deck 2 - the "jogging" deck. Yet to see anyone jog on this cruise ...!

The weather today not quite as good as yesterday. Back to grey skies without too much visibility. We can just about see the Russian coastline on the horizon but there isn't much to see.

Tonight, the World Cafe hosted an Indian Buffet Night, with exotically-named dishes like "Dhabe ka Gosht", "Dydhiya Murgh Tikka", "Lasooni Palak Chilgoza", "Jalebi Rabdi" and "Mishti Dhoi".
