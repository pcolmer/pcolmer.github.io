Not much happened today! When my wife & I went on the Italian Sojourn cruise a couple of years' ago, that cruise finished in Rome and we had a post-cruise extension where we had a couple of days to ourselve. We filled that with visits to the Colosseum, the Pantheon and the Vatican. We had a lovely time and we didn't want to "spoil" those memories with an excursion that would require driving into Rome, doing the tour and then driving all the way back to the ship.

So, instead, we decided to stay on the ship. We weren't the only ones but it did lead to the ship being a **lot** quieter.

Our day consisted of:

* Having coffee delivered to our stateroom as a prelude to breakfast.
* Having a relaxing, cooked breakfast for a change.
* Getting the washing and ironing done.
* Sitting in the Library section of the Living Room.
* Lunch.
* Walking 4 laps (1 mile) of the promenada deck.
* Played 5 games of Monopoly Deal ... and my wife won üòÅ
* Dinner in the World Cafe.
* Went to the Star Theatre for the Beatles Songbook with the ship's singers. Really good show and great voices!
