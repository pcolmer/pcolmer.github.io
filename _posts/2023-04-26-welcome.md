Welcome to Techie Travelling - a blog that is a mixture of posts about techie stuff (mostly gadgets) and posts about travelling (mostly holidays).

To set expectations, I will be posting *occasionally* and mostly while on holiday.

Hopefully, you will find what I post useful, helpful and informative.

I'm in the process of migrating this blog from WordPress so, until I complete that, older posts can be found at [https://techietravelling.wordpress.com](https://techietravelling.wordpress.com/).
