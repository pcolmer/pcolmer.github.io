Another very rough day at sea, with the decks closed off to passengers for safety reasons.

Last day of progressive trivia today. The questions were easier but they were easy for everyone - and the host knew it. Ultimately, we didn't do well enough to get back to the top but we had fun nevertheless. Trivia on subsequent sea days will be just one-off scoring.

By the afternoon, the sea had calmed down enough for us to get some fresh air on the top deck of the ship, which always makes a nice change from walking on the "jogging track" on deck 2.

We had deliberately chosen to have a small lunch because we were determined to fit in Afternoon Tea!

Afternoon Tea, held in the Wintergarden on Viking Ocean ships, consists of some small sandwiches (one plate each) and a shared plate of some small cakes, plus a scone with cream and jam. Oh, and tea! There is an extensive tea menu to choose from. There is often live music during Afternoon Tea and, this time, it was the cellist and violinist.

For dinner, we ate at the World Cafe with two other passengers that we have made friends with during this cruise.

After dinner, we watched the port talk for tomorrow's arrival at Dutch Harbor, as well as Hidden Figures on our stateroom TV. An excellent movie and heartily recommended.

In addition to the enrichment lectures that take place during the cruise, as well as the live music, there is also a lot of art around the ship. Each stateroom has a book that explains the art that can be discovered. In addition, next to each piece of art is a sign with more information as well as an ID number. If you put that number into the Art section of the Viking app, you get an audio playback of more information about that piece, as well as suggested associated pieces of art. The art around the ship is plentiful and **varied** in nature and style.
