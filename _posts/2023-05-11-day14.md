Ugh! Another really rough night as the ship is back out in the open seas, making its way from Dutch Harbor, Unalaska to Kodiak. Still, it didn't take long for the day to brighten up.

In the morning, we attended a short (20-minute-ish) presentation in the Explorers' Dome - a planetarium installation that, as far as I can tell, only exists on the Viking Orion and the Viking Jupiter. It has been many years since I've been to a planetarium and it was interesting to learn more about constellations.

Tying in with the installation of the planetarium, the Orion's godmother is Dr Anna Fisher, an American chemist, physician and retired NASA astronaut:

Trivia today was back to the more conventional setup ... and so was our score - just 11 out of 15.

Unfortunately, by the afternoon, the weather had become blustery again so we went up to decks 8 & 9 for a change. Walking in one direction along the ship had the wind pushing us along while walking in the other direction required us to lean into the wind, it was that strong. Still, it was nice to get some fresh air and exercise!

We ate at the World Cafe for dinner; it has the flexibility of allowing us to have little bits of everything from the buffet.

For a change, we watched the evening entertainment from the Star Theatre on our stateroom TV. We weren't *entirely* sure if we would want to watch the whole show but we did enjoy it. The show starred Robert Neary, an actor who has been in a number of different TV shows. Somewhat unusually, though, he didn't just sing some songs - he did them as Neil Diamond, as he does in his touring tribute show - [So Good, the Neil Diamond Experience](https://sogoodtheneildiamondexperience.com/).
